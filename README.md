# Homework 2: Responsive portfolio
Use Bootstrap to create a mobile responsive portfolio

## A Few Notes:
* I used the HTML boilerplate from the getbootstrap website which gave me boilerplate HTML as well as the Boostrap CSS link and the Bootstrap JS 

### Navbar
* I created a navbar that is consistent on all three HTML pages
* I used a pretty basic code example from the Bootstrap site for the navbar
* The changes I made to the navbar included:
    * The navbar background color and the text color
    * I deleted one list item since I only need three
    * I added links to all of the HTML pages
    * I changed the text content to be the names of the pages
    * I added some margin classes to make the navbar items and the navbar itself spaced out better

### Footer
* I created a footer that is consistent on all three HTML pages
* I did not use a reference for this part
* I used the grid system for the three parts in the footer
* Each part was its own column and one part was icons with clickable links to my social media
* It is responsive, any size smaller than medium size pushed the three parts into columns
    * Otherwise they are spaced out with space between them
* I had to manually set the right margin to 0 because for some reason, the margin was pushing the width to be much bigger than needed
