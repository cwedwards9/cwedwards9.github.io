          <p class="aboutPar">Hi, my name is Chase Edwards! I live in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In my free time I love to 
            play rec soccer, run, and play video games. Growing up, I have always had an interest in technology whether it 
            was shooting and editing videos with my friends or playing video games. I have some experience with web 
            development from a class I took for my undergraduate degree and through an internship in college. I have 
            also recently been learning it on my own through Udemy.

          <h2 class="aboutTitle">College</h2>
          <p class="aboutPar">I graduated from the University of Akron in December of 2019. I earned my Bachelor's of Business Administration
            Degree in Information Systems Management. The classes I took for this degree is how I was first introduced
            to the very basics of computer programming. I learned C#, SQL, and some JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. I was
            able to utilized what I knew from my classes in a summer internship and  from there, my interest in web 
            development continued to grow. I tried to study it on the side, but I didn't have much time to focus on it 
            while in college.

          <h2 class="aboutTitle">Now</h2>
          <p class="aboutPar">After graduation, I spent a lot of time searching for positions related to my degree. I 
            applied for business analyst positons and other jobs related to working with data and technoology. I had a 
            few interviews, but nothing stuck and I felt discouraged and questioned that particular career path. 
            When COVID-19 hit the US, I knew my search was going to be a lot more difficult. A few months later, I came 
            across Case Western's Coding Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development. It didn't take much time for me to 
            decide this was the perfect time to make the lunge into this amazing industry.
