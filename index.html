          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Chase Edwards! I live in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In my free time I love to play rec soccer 
            and run as well as play video games. Growing up, I have always had an interest in technology whether it 
            was shooting and editing videos with my friends or playing video games. I have some past web development
            experience through an internship in college as well as a few classes in my undergraduate. I have also utilized
            Udemy to help me learn more through my experiences.

          <h2>College</h2>
          <p>I graduated from the University of Akron in December of 2019. I earned my Bachelor's of Business Administration
            Degree in Information Systems Management. The classes I took for this degree is where I was first introduced
            to the very basics of computer programming. I learned C# and some JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. 
            From there my interest in web development kept growing and growing. At the time, I wasn't really set on 
            becoming a web developer since that was not what I was studying in my undergrad.

          <h2>Now</h2>
          <p>After graduation, I spent a lot of time searching for positions related to my studies. I applied for business
            analyst positons and other jobs related to working with data and technoology. I had a few interviews, but 
            nothing was sticking and I felt discouraged and questioned this particular career path. When COVID-19 hit 
            the US, I knew my search was going to be a lot more difficult. One day I came across Case Western's Coding
            Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development. It didn't take much time for me to decide this was the perfect time to 
            make the lunge into this amazing industry.
